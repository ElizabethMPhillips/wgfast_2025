    "comment": "Introduced in echopype for Simrad echosounders to avoid potential confusion with convention definitions. The athwartship angle corresponds to the major angle in SONAR-netCDF4 vers 2. The convention defines one-way transmit or receive beamwidth (beamwidth_receive_major and beamwidth_transmit_major), but Simrad echosounders record two-way beamwidth in the data.",
